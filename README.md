# This Repo is for testing and learning MLOps platforms, tools and frameworks.
Currently testing ZenML framework with using pipelines. MLFlow is integrated with ZenML for experiment tracking. 

**ZenML** is a platform that unifies ML workflows into one streamlined, integrated platform. It allows you to develop ML pipelines locally and run them on any MLOps stack.

**MLflow** is a unified, end-to-end platform for building and deploying ML and generative AI applications. It supports experiment tracking, visualization, evaluation, model management, serving, and integration with various tools and platforms. 

**Note:** Looks like ZenML framework doesn't support deploying wtim MLflow yet? So experiment is not completed.
